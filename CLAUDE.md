# ReceivingOps — Project Context

Multi-warehouse receiving system. ASP.NET Core 8 MVC + Dapper + SQL Server.
**Currently on v2** of the spec (PO-driven receiving with FIFO allocation).

## Stack
- .NET 8 LTS, C# 12
- Dapper (no EF Core, no string concat in SQL)
- SQL Server (local: LAPTOP-CSB3KO3E)
- Cookie auth, PBKDF2 password hashing
- Bootstrap 5.3 + Bootstrap Icons frontend

## Source of truth
- `BUILD_PROMPT.md` — **v2 spec** (read this first). PO is the quantity cap;
  receives are FIFO-allocated across PO lines server-side.
- `BUILD_PROMPT.v1.md` — archived v1 spec (per-hour cap; single-row receive).
  Kept for archaeology only; live build follows v2.
- `mockups/` — HTML files that define the UI exactly (do not redesign).
- `db/` — schema migrations 001–014. Re-runnable: 001/002 idempotent +
  010–014 are the v1→v2 migration chain (additive 1a → backfill 2 → strict
  1b → view modernize 3 → smoke sandbox 4).

## Conventions
- PascalCase SQL columns matching POCO properties (no Dapper mapping)
- Repositories `Scoped`, services `Scoped`, password hasher `Singleton`
- Every write writes an audit row via `IAuditService`
- Receipts table is APPEND-ONLY (no UPDATE except `ReversedById`, no DELETE)
- All numeric arithmetic is whole units (int, not decimal)

## v2 invariants (load-bearing)
- **PO cap is the hard limit (§7.1).** Per-hour `PullItemWindows.ExpectedQty`
  is a planning hint; overage is allowed if PO capacity exists.
- **FIFO is server-only (§7.14).** The modal MUST NOT expose a PO selector.
  The server allocates by `PurchaseOrders.OrderDate ASC, PoNumber ASC`.
- **One receive call may produce multiple `Receipts` rows (§7.2a)** when the
  FIFO walk splits qty across PO lines. The response shape is
  `{ allocations[], totalQty, newReceivedQty, fullyReceived }`.
- **Cancel restores qty to the SAME PO line the original consumed (§7.3).**
  No FIFO logic on the way back. Auto-reopens the PO if it had auto-closed.
- **PO immutability (§7.13).** PUT/DELETE on PO or PO line refused (409)
  while any receipt references it. `POST /api/pos/{id}/close` is the only
  way to retire a PO with outstanding qty.
- **Locking pattern**: receive transaction uses
  `WITH (UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK, ROWLOCK)` on the FIFO read of
  `dbo.PurchaseOrderLines` — gives serializable range protection so two
  concurrent receivers can't double-spend a line.

## Workflow
1. Schema first (`db/001_schema.sql` then `db/010_…`–`014_…` for v2) before
   any C# code.
2. Run SQL → verify with `tools/verify-phase-*.ps1` → then build
   repositories → services → controllers.
3. Demo each layer before moving on (see BUILD_PROMPT.md §15).

## Connection string
Local dev only — lives in `dotnet user-secrets` (set by
`tools/verify-phase-1a.ps1` / committed in `appsettings.Development.json`
breadcrumb). Production must use Managed Identity or a vault — never a
hardcoded SQL login.
